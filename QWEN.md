# Lokeshen App - Spatialite Integration

## Project Overview

Lokeshen is a location-based application that leverages Spatialite capabilities to perform geospatial queries on Android devices. The app allows users to:

1. Load a database of locations in Kenya
2. Perform geospatial queries to find nearby locations based on device location
3. Save notes with location data
4. Query notes within specific radius or geographic boundaries

## Technical Approach

The app uses native modules to integrate Spatialite functionality for efficient geospatial operations. We're implementing our own Spatialite solution using modern Kotlin libraries rather than porting existing libraries that may have compatibility issues.

## Native Modules

We have created a dedicated native module `expo-spatialite-room` that will handle all Spatialite operations:

- **Module Name**: `ExpoSpatialiteRoom`
- **Platform**: Android (iOS and web support planned for future)
- **Library**: Using SpatiaRoom Kotlin library for modern Spatialite implementation
- **Features**: 
  - Database initialization and management
  - Geospatial query operations
  - Location-based data storage and retrieval

## Game Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Integration
1. Configure the SpatiaRoom library in our native module
2. Implement basic database creation and initialization
3. Create core API for database operations

### Phase 2: Geospatial Functionality
1. Implement location data storage with coordinates
2. Add geospatial query capabilities:
   - Find nearby locations within radius
   - Bounding box queries
   - Distance calculations
3. Test with sample Kenya location data

### Phase 3: Application Integration
1. Connect native module to React Native application
2. Implement user interface for location queries
3. Add note-taking functionality with location data
4. Optimize performance and handle edge cases

## Dependencies

- Expo modules for native integration
- SpatiaRoom Kotlin library for Spatialite operations
- AndroidX compatibility libraries

## Directives

- Focus on Android implementation first
- Keep the module self-contained and well-documented
- Use modern Kotlin practices and AndroidX compatibility
- Test with real-world Kenya location data
- Ensure proper error handling and validation

## Future Enhancements

- iOS support using similar approach
- Web implementation for cross-platform compatibility
- Advanced geospatial operations (buffers, intersections, etc.)
- Offline map data integration
- Sync capabilities for location data
