The idea of this project is to create an expo compatible native module for the react native library [rn-spatial-example](https://github.com/tigawanna/RNSpatial).

`.rn-spatial-example` :  # React native library to work with sqlite spatialite it's not expo compatibe and am trying to make a native module of it for expo , it conssts of cherry pickked portions that i think are most relevant

`modules/expo-spatialite-module` :  # inittial boilerplate expo native module for sqlite spatialite , feel free to remove the code for the views since we're only intrested in the native module part . i will also limit this to android only for now so we'll onlu focus on android part of the native module
